# JavaScript Uno

## Intro
This game was written JavaScript, CSS & HTML for SEI-22 Project 1.
Uno images are generated with CSS!

Rules here:

(However, in my game, starter card being an action card has no effect on the first player, and if it is a wildcard, a color is randomly chosen. There is also no need to say Uno. Haha.)

## Bugs
* There are some errors that occur, specifically "...cannot read length property of undefined at line 471" within the console.
I haven't figured out why or which conditions causes it to occur yet.
* Occasionally, when there is a winner, the winner display might show player as "null" instead of the winner.
